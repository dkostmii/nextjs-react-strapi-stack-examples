# nextjs-react-strapi-stack-examples

This repository will contain multiple example
projects on NextJS, React and Strapi stack.

Projects will be organized in monorepo fashion,
to avoid creating a ton of separate repositories for each
toolset example.

## General info

Use [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [NVM for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)
to have multiple Node.JS versions on your machine.

For example, [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) CMS requires you to install LTS version
of NodeJS, but your project may be running on latest version.
